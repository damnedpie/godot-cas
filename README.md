CAS SDK 4.1.2 Android plugin for Godot. Built on Godot 3.6 AAR.

[**Official Android Wiki**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki)

## Setup

### Project integration

1. Add plugin files (.gd, .gdap, .aar) into your project's `android/plugins`.

2. Add `GodotCas.gd` as a singleton (autoload) to your project.

3. Add your Google AdMob ID to `android/build/AndroidManifest.xml`:
	```xml
	<application android:label="@string/godot_project_name_string" android:allowBackup="false" android:isGame="true" android:hasFragileUserData="false" android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="false" tools:ignore="GoogleAppIndexingWarning" android:icon="@mipmap/icon">
			<meta-data
				android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
				android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713" />
				<!-- Other metadata... -->
	```

4. Get your `cas_settings[settings_id].json` file from CAS dashboard and put it into `android/build/res/raw` folder.

5. (Optional) Add `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` permission to your Android export template if you want to use AD ID (which is usually the case). You can also add `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` and `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` permissions if your app has real usecases for those (this can improve monetization).

### Android 7.1.1 and 7.1.2

Currently there are issues with some adapters causing crashes on API levels 25 and 26 (7.1.1 and 7.1.2). This is caused by some other adapters forcing 'play-services-ads-identifier:18.2.0' while the adapters in question can only work with 'play-services-ads-identifier:18.2.0'. If you are supporting those API levels, add the following to your `android/build/build.gradle`:

```groovy
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.1.0'
    }
}

```

[More info on this issue here.](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/issues/26)


### Ad network adapters

This plugin's configuration file `GodotCas.gdap` contains all adapters out of the box (excluding beta and cross-promo). Usually it's not desirable because your app may be not making use of all of them and having unnecessary adapters present will increase build size. Feel free to add/remove adapters and their repositories according to your needs.

Make sure to check out [**this list of adapters**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/tree/master/Adapters#casai-mediation-adapters) and also [**this guide page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Manual-setup) from CAS official wiki.

Also check `adapters-list.txt` for precise dependencies and repositories for Optimal and Families presets.

### Other optional dependencies

`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier` dependency is required if you want to use AD ID (which is preferrable).

`com.tenjin:android-sdk` dependency would be necessary if you want to enable automatic revenue reporting for Tenjin. [**See this wiki page for more details**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Impression-Level-Data#tenjin).


## Initialization

Wrapper script `GodotCas.gd` has `initialize()` method which you are supposed to edit and then call in runtime. There are some methods that tweak initialization options for the SDK, and you have to call them before `initializeCAS()` is executed. Each method in the wrapper is documented by a comment, so make sure to inspect it.

### Initialization settings

All methods below should come before `initializeCAS()` if called.

```gdscript
# Mandatory. Sets CAS ID (usually your app package or bundle ID).
# Not setting the ID before initializeCas() will lead to plugin crash.
setCasId(id:String) -> void

# CAS built in consent manager is enabled by default, but you can disable it.
# It's still recommended to use their consent manager, so better leave it be.
setUseBuiltInConsentManager(enabled:bool) -> void

# If enabled, turns test ads mode on.
setTestAdMode(enabled:bool) -> void

# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Impression-Level-Data#automatic-collect-ad-revenue
# If using this, make sure you have TenjinSDK dependency in GodotCas.gdap configuration.
setTenjinKey(key:String) -> void

# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Additional-Meta-AudienceNetwork-steps
setFacebookLDU(enabled:bool) -> void
```

### Testing and debugging

```gdscript
# Debug Mode displays debug info with log tag "CAS". Disabled by default for performance.
setDebugMode(enabled:bool) -> void

# Adds testing device ID.
# see https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Enabling-test-ads#enable-test-devices
addTestDeviceId(id:String) -> void
```

## Working with user data consent

[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/User-Consent-Flow)

### Automatic flow

CAS SDK provides automated consent screen workflow with their own consent screen.

```gdscript
# Shows consent manager if it is required (e.g. based on user's geo).
showConsentManagerIfRequired() -> void

# Force-shows the consent manager.
showConsentManager() -> void
```

### Manual flow

In case you use your own consent screen, consent status can be set via these methods:

```gdscript
enum CONSENT_STATUS {
	UNDEFINED = 0
	ACCEPTED = 1
	DENIED = 2
}

# Use this if using your own consent manager. See CONSENT_STATUS enum.
setConsentStatus(status:int) -> void

enum CCPA_STATUS {
	UNDEFINED = 0
	OPT_OUT_SALE = 1
	OPT_IN_SALE = 2
}

# Use this if using your own consent manager. See CCPA_STATUS enum.
setCcpaStatus(status:int) -> void
```

### Testing consent flow
You can also test consent screen behavior to make sure everything works as intended.

```gdscript
# Returns possible consent flow statuses as String : int dict for lookup.
getPossibleConsentFlowStatuses() -> Dictionary

# Returns possible debug geographies as String : int dict for lookup.
getPossibleDebugGeographies() -> Dictionary

# Sets debug geography for consent manager testing.
# Will have no effect unless force testing is enabled for consent manager.
setConsentDebugGeography(geography:int) -> void

# Enabled forced testing for consent manager.
setConsentForceTesting(enabled:bool) -> void
```

## Children-directed treatment
[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Privacy-Regulations)

Developers who have knowledge of specific individuals as being COPPA-applicable should make use of the API discussed below to inform CAS and all downstream consumers of this information.

```gdscript
enum AUDIENCE {
	UNDEFINED = 0
	CHILDRED = 1
	NOT_CHILDREN = 2
}

# Specify what audience is the user in. See AUDIENCE enum.
setTaggedAudience(audienceType:int) -> void

```

## Ad types

This plugin supports Interstitial, Rewarded, Banner and App Open ad types. Native ad type is not currently implemented due to having extremely few use cases in games.

Every ad-type has a corresponding initialization function: `initializeInterstitial()`, `initializeRewarded()` and so on. Make sure you call such a function before calling other methods relevant to an ad type.

### Interstitial
[**Official wiki page** ](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Interstitial-Ads)

```gdscript
# Initializes the CASInterstitial object in the plugin and creates callbacks.
initializeInterstitial() -> void

# Loads the interstitial ad.
loadInterstitial() -> void

# Returns false is ad is not loaded yet or the CASInterstitial object hasn't been initialized.
isInterstitialLoaded() -> bool

# Shows the interstitial ad.
showInterstitial() -> void

# Destroys the interstitial ad instance.
destroyInterstitial() -> void

# Sets autoloading for interstitials, disabled by default.
setAutoloadInterstitial(enabled:bool) -> void

# Sets an interval between interstitial ad shows prohibiting ads from showing during it.
setMinIntervalInterstitial(seconds:int) -> void

# Restarts the interval specified by setMinIntervalInterstitial().
restartIntervalInterstitial() -> void
```

### Rewarded
[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Rewarded-Ads)
```gdscript
# Initializes the CASRewarded object in the plugin and creates callbacks.
initializeRewarded() -> void

# Loads the rewarded ad.
loadRewarded() -> void

# Returns false is ad is not loaded yet or the CASRewarded object hasn't been initialized.
isRewardedLoaded() -> bool

# Shows the rewarded ad.
showRewarded() -> void

# Destroys the rewarded ad instance.
destroyRewarded() -> void

# Sets autoloading for rewarded, disabled by default.
setAutoloadRewarded(enabled:bool) -> void

# Enabled by default. Sets if an interstitial ad should be displayed in case there is no-fill for rewarded.
setRewardedExtraFillInterstitial(enabled:bool) -> void
```

### Banner
[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Banner-Ads)
```gdscript
# Initializes CASBannerView. See BANNER_SIZE enum.
# Also see https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Banner-Ads#set-ad-size
initializeBanner(bannerSize:int) -> void

# Initializes CASBannerView with adaptive size.
# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Banner-Ads#adaptive-banners
initializeAdaptiveBanner(maxWidthDpi:int) -> void

# Loads the banner ad.
loadBanner() -> void

# Returns false if ad is not loaded yet or the CASBannerView object hasn't been initialized.
isBannerLoaded() -> bool

# Sets banner visibility.
setBannerVisible(isVisible:bool) -> void

# Destroys the banner ad instance.
destroyBanner() -> void

# Sets autoloading for banner. Enabled by default.
setAutoloadBanner(enabled:bool) -> void

# Sets banner refresh interval. Should be longer than 10 seconds, 30 considered optimal (default).
setBannerRefreshInterval(seconds:int) -> void

# Disables ad refresh for banner.
disableBannerAdRefresh() -> void

# Sets banner position in device's actual viewport.
setBannerPosition(posX:float, posY:float) -> void

# Returns banner width in device's actual viewport.
getBannerWidth() -> int

# Returns banner height in device's actual viewport.
getBannerHeight() -> int
```

### App Open ads
[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/App-Open-Ads)
```gdscript
# Initializes the CASAppOpen object in the plugin and creates callbacks.
initializeAppOpenAd() -> void

# Loads the AppOpen ad.
loadAppOpenAd() -> void

# Returns false if ad is not loaded yet or the CASAppOpen object hasn't been initialized.
isAppOpenAdLoaded() -> bool

# Shows the AppOpen ad.
showAppOpenAd() -> void

# Destroys the AppOpen ad instance.
destroyAppOpenAd() -> void

# Sets autoloading for AppOpen ad, disabled by default.
setAutoloadAppOpenAd(enabled:bool) -> void

# Sets autoshowing for AppOpen ad, disabled by default.
setAutoshowAppOpenAd(enabled:bool) -> void
```

### IAP logging with Tenjin

You can log in-app purchase events to Tenjin with this plugin. Just make sure to obtain the necessary `purchase` data from Godot Google Play Billing Library Plugin.

You will probably be calling this from inside `purchases_updated` signal of Billing Plugin, but I strongly advise you call logging with some delay (like 2 seconds). Reason being, TenjinSDK might be suspended in this particular moment and there's a possibility that your logging attempt won't go through.

More info on data required can be found in [Tenjin docs](https://docs.tenjin.com/docs/android-sdk#purchase-events)
```gdscript
# Data for arguments is supposed to be obtained from Google Billing Library plugin for Godot.
# CAS should be initialized with Tenjin key for this to work (might cause crash otherwise).
logTenjinPurchaseEvent(sku:String, currencyCode:String, quantity:int, price:float, originalJson:String, signature:String) -> void
```

## Targeting options

[**Official wiki page**](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Targeting-options)

# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Targeting-options#user-id
setUserID(userID:String) -> void

# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Targeting-options#user-age
setUserAge(age:int) -> void

enum GENDER {
	UNKNOWN = 0,
	MALE = 1,
	FEMALE = 2
}

# See GENDER enum for the argument.
# See https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-Android/wiki/Targeting-options#user-gender
